# wdio-test

Using WebdriverIO to scrape the Firefox Monitor site.

## WHAT

Currently there is just one simple test in the test/specs/* directory which:
1. launches the homepage,
2. enters an email address to scan,
3. submits the form,
4. scrapes the results page and confirms the correct email was scanned and the scan results headline displays the number of breaches for the specified account.

## HOW

```sh
npm test

> wdio-test@1.0.0 test /Volumes/Dev/github/pdehaan/wdio-test
> wdio run wdio.conf.js
